# NBA PLAYER STAT SEARCH
## What's the purpose?
The program is made for National Basketball Association enthusiasts and analysts who might want to get more accurate statistics on a player as well as get 
deeper analysis on trends that have taken place over a certain period.

## What does the program do?
- Print out the statistic that the user requested
- Print out team rosters
- Print out all statistics for the player in the current season if the requested stat is not understood or unavailable
- Perform player comparisons
- Print out an interesting trend in statistics e.g the average height of players has reduced by 11% from 1992 to 2022. (coming soon)
- Print out the standings in both the eastern and western conferences (Updated daily manually)

## What tools were used?
- Python programming
- Natural Language Processing in AI
- Libraries such as NLTK, CoreNLP, Pandas, Openpyxl, spaCy, NumPy, Pomegranate
- Microsoft Excel and Visual Studio Code
- Data from Kaggle and NBA.com

## Challenges faced
- Difficulty in actualizing the program into a website or an app
- Limited knowledge of databases that prevents me from updating the data automatically

## Tasks left
- Fix up bugs in the algorithm file that performs the analysis part of the program
- Use a database that updates periodically on its own
- Convert the program into a website
